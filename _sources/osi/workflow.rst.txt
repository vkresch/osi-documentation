Branching Workflow (member)
-----------------------------

- Create issues for **fundamental** changes!
- Clone repository on your local machine
- Create a branch with a meaningfull name: ``prefix/name``, ``feature/new-environmental-conditions``
- prefixes: feature, experimental, bug, etc.
- Add your suggestions to the code Do not use: ``*git add -A *git commit -A``
- The code should compile for a pull-request! ^_^
- Try to make small changes for easier discussions
- The person willing to merge needs to change the InterfaceVersion according to :ref:`versioning` before hitting merge
